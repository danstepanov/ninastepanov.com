This is my GitHub Page made with [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com). I've made it to play with front end development, to showcase my work, and to share my articles on iOS. You can download, fork and share the code. 

## Acknowledgements

I largely copied the website from [Ed Sancha's](http://edsancha.com) personal webpage. You can find his source code in his [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/EdSancha)
